 Using the ESP 32 microcontroller, the smart home system is designed to control the air conditioner and heater virtually based on temperature conditions . When the temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius,the heater is activated to warm the environment. Conversely, when the temperature exceeds 26 degrees Celsius,the system triggers the fan and air conditioner to maintain a comfortable temperature. This functionality is achieved through the automation capabilities of the ESP 32 , allowing for efficient and responsive control of the heating and cooling systems in the smart home environment. also design smart Switch Boards for controlling switches and also check live states of any switch
